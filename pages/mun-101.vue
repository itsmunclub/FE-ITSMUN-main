            <p>Study Guide is a document written by the chairs which contains <strong>basic information about the topic and the council.</strong> It is usually handed three weeks before your performance.
              <br><br>
              Generally, UN councils can be differentiated as <strong>low-pol and high-pol.</strong> Low-pol councils are usually considered as beginner friendly since there isn’t many politic and contention happen there. Example of low-pol such as UNHCR and UNESCO. As for high-pol council, there are many political things that delegates need to understand. The examples are UNSC and Crisis. 
              <br><br>
              However, in some conferences you might be able to find unique councils or international bodies such as African Union (AU), G20, European Union (EU), and Asean. The main thing that delegates need to understand is to <strong>make sure their solutions and flow of debate are in line with the mandate of the council that they’re in.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3 class="text-2xl py-8">Mandates</h3>
            <p>A mandate is the authority to carry out policy or course of action. The mandate of a council directly influences the solution that a delegate can bring into the debate, i.e on one hand a delegate may bring forward an economic sanction as a part of their solution in one council (UNSC). On the other hand, a delegate might only be able to propose a recommendation as their main solution in other.</p>
